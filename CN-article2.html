        <h1>Sigma stages International Nursing Conference in U.S. - OLFU represents and soars!</h1>
        <p class="block1-body block1-b1">
            Defying gravity brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and serving as a "salute" to the ability of humanity to bounce back 
            was a successful convergence of nurses and health practitioners in an international conference.
        </p>
        <p class="block1-body block1-b2">
            On November 6 to 10, 2021, the leading organization on global nursing excellence, SIGMA, hosted their 46th Biennial 
            Convention in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. Bringing together 2,051 attendees from 47 countries and seven regions, the 
            hybrid event involved both in-person and virtual modes. 
        </p>
        <p class="block1-body block1-b2">
            Themed "Honor the Past, Remember the Present, Create the Future", the convention also marked 100 years of Sigma Nursing. 
            Notably, the five-day business assemblage saw representatives from Our Lady of Fatima University making their presence felt. 
        </p>
        <p class="block1-body block1-b2">
            A November 5th pre-conference event, billed as "ONLINE-Originating Novel Learning Innovations in Nursing Education [In-person and Virtual]" 
            and designated as Excellence in Nursing Education Day, featured OLFU's Dr. Michael Joseph Dino, Director of the Research Development and 
            Innovation Center. With his segment entitled "Nurse #Frontlearners GoFLEX: OBE-dized Teaching and Learning Strategies during Challenging Times", 
            Dr. Dino presented OLFU's GoFLEX model for teaching and learning within an outcomes-based approach during the COVID-19 pandemic. He showcased 
            best practices using contemporary technology and adaptive traditional techniques in enhancing student experience in both virtual and blended 
            learning modalities.
        </p>
        <p class="block1-body block1-b2">
            Then, members of OLFU's College of Nursing "took the virtual stage" at the convention through their researches:

        <p class="block1-body block1-b2">
            "COVID-19 Anxiety and Stigma as Moderatos of the Job Demands and ProQOL among Filipino  
            Nurses". The research makes an in-depth study of Filipino nurses handling COVID-19 patients; of how the pandemic's 
            resulting anxiety and stigma have impacted on job demands brought upon the nurses. Comprised of OLFU's nursing students, 
            the team was led by Primary Presenting Author Carmina Angeli Caparaz who recieved support from more than able support 
            from Secondary Presenting Authors: Ma. Andrea Arceo, Lovely Shane Clavite, Ma. Bernie Mae Marquez, and Francesca Alysse Perez. 
            Serving as advisors were OLFU Professors Sharon Cajayon, Brylle Capili, and Dr. Michael Joseph Dino.
        </p>
        <p class="block1-body block1-b2">
            Student Nurses Caparaz, Arceo, Clavite, Marquez, and Perez were recognized by Sigma as Rising Stars Presenters. 
        </p>
        <p class="block1-body block1-b2">

            by Dr. Irvin Ong and Dr. Dino. 
        </p>
        <p class="block1-body block1-b2">

        </p>
        <p class="block1-body block1-b2">
            During the Biennial Convention, OLFU's very own Dr. Michael Joseph Dino received two awards from Sigma.
        </p>
        <p class="block1-body block1-b2">
            First, he was awarded the Virginia Henderson Fellow for his philanthropic leadership in advancing research 
            for nurses who are improving world health. The Fellow is in honor of Virginia A. Henderson who is considered 
            as the leading American nurse of the 20th century, and who is known internationally for her lasting influence 
            on nursing practice, education, and research.
        </p>
        <p class="block1-body block1-b2">
            Then Dr. Dino likewise received the Chapter Key Award on behalf of progressive contributions made by the Phi
            Gamma Chapter where Dr. Dino serves as the current President.
