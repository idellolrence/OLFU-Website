        <h1>Psychologist Dr. Robert Sternberg tackles the Western Conception of Intelligence at
            Psychological Society-QC Webinar</h1>
        <p class="block1-body block1-b1">
            Renowned psychologist Dr. Robert Sternberg was the honored speaker in the webinar, "Time Bomb: How the Western Conception of 
            Intelligence is Taking Down Humanity". Held on 06 May 2021, the conference was an initiative of the student organization, 
            the Psychology Society, based in the Quezon City Campus of Our Lady of Fatima University (OLFU).
        </p>
        <p class="block1-body block1-b2">
            A professor of human development at Cornell University, Dr. Sternberg is famous for the Sternberg Test of Mental Ability (STOMA), 
            the triarchic theory of intelligence, and the triangular theory of love.
        </p>
        <p class="block1-body block1-b2">
            Formally opening the program, OLFU President Dr. Caroline Marian Enriquez expressed excited anticipation in learning from Dr. Sternberg, 
            and underscored how opportune the event was, considering the present circumstances brought about by the pandemic. “We view this webinar as 
            very timely considering the current times where we all have to make our adjustments and we have to find out in our own ways how we could be 
            more resilient and adapt to the changes of the times,” Dr. Enriquez averred.
        </p>
        <p class="block1-body block1-b2">
            Dr. Sternberg began his talk by specifying some known man-made "disasters," and all of these have one thing in common: "They are a result, directly 
            or indirectly, of 'intelligence' as conceptualized in the West." He proceeded to discuss the advantages of having a high intelligence quotient or IQ." 
            IQ predicts lots of shorter- and longer-term individual successes. But even long- term success for the individual is short-term for humanity-it has produced 
            a tragedy of the commons," he argued in his presentation. "We rely on collective intelligence," Dr. Sternberg said. 
        </p>
        <p class="block1-body block1-b2">
            "By focusing on individual intelligence, we lose sight of the importance of collective intelligence." According to him, "failure to take into account collective 
            intelligence magnifies the effects of IQ + knowledge, both constructive and destructive," hence his examples of disasters. He also underscored how the effects of 
            this problem will radiate to the next generations.
        </p>
        <p class="block1-body block1-b2">
            Moving on to standardized academic testing, Dr. Sternberg led an extensive discussion on the elements of 
            "an Augmented and Adaptive View of "Successful Intelligence' which he argued. These are: Creativity, Common Sense, 
            and Wisdom, in addition to Domain- general Analytical Skills and Domain-specific Analytical Skills. He also detailed 
            how these were measured in his studies with fellow academics. "Standardized tests, based on modern Western notions of 
            intelligence, are seriously limited and narrow because modern Western notions of intelligence are seriously limited 
            and narrow," Dr. Sternberg pointed out.
        </p>
        <p class="block1-body block1-b2">
            In relation to this, he identified reasons why psychometric testing remained in the olden thought. As a conclusion, 
            he said, "What we need in identifying students as smart, as gifted is not transactionally smart people." "We need people 
            who want to transform the world to make it a better place, who want to make a difference. So let's make the world a better place!"
        </p>
        <p class="block1-body block1-b2">
            Participants of the webinar also had an opportunity to ask questions and exchange insights with Dr. Sternberg. Topics talked about 
            include tacit knowledge and practical intelligence, change in the educational system, and practical intelligence in finding solutions 
            to the pandemic.
